# EDUCATX

#### Brief Description of Project - 
3rd year 1st semester group project for the module Application Frameworks was developed using MERN stack framework. This project is an online Research Tool management system. Basically this is a moodle web site to manage academic researches for the education institute called EDUCATX. Once the user logs into the system, he can view the course meterials, submissions and notices etc. This side contains both admin and student sides. Admin can add all the course meterials, notices, panel members etc. From the student side, they can register into groups, view submissions, upload submissions such as documents, research meterials etc. Not only that, they can view their panel members and chat with them like we used to do in Microsoft teams. At the same time the staff members can also be the users of this site. Once they are active members they can get the notifications if they are allocated into a panel as well. If they are inactive they can make a request to the admin to make them as active.  
In order to deliver an efficient product, the system was constructed utilizing the MongoDB database, the Express framework, React Js, and Node Js.
